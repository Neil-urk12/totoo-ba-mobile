## üîß Bug Fixes


### Text Search Functionality


#### Issue #1: Food Products Misclassified as Drug Products

**Severity**: High ¬†

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed


**Problem**:

- When searching for food products using text search, the results screen incorrectly displayed them as "Drug Product"

- The product card header showed "Drug Product" label instead of "Food Product"

- This issue affected all food products in the database


**Root Cause**:

- The `_convertFoodResults()` method in `text_verification_service.dart` was incorrectly setting the `genericName` field (which is drug-specific) to the food product's `product_name`

- This caused the GenericProduct model to misidentify food products as drugs


**Solution**:

- Completely rewrote the `_convertFoodResults()` method to properly map food-specific fields

- Set `genericName` to `null` for food products (as it should only be used for drugs)

- Added proper mapping for `companyName` and `typeOfProduct` fields

- Correctly mapped `company_name` to both `manufacturer` and `companyName` fields

- Added proper date parsing for `issuanceDate` and `expiryDate`


**Impact**: All food products now correctly display as "Food Product" in text search results


---


#### Issue #2: Drug-Specific Fields Populated for Non-Drug Products

**Severity**: Medium ¬†

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed


**Problem**:

- Food, cosmetic, and medical device products were incorrectly having drug-specific fields populated

- Fields like `genericName`, `dosageStrength`, `dosageForm` were showing data for non-drug products


**Root Cause**:

- The generic `_convertResults()` helper method was setting `genericName` for all product types

- Cosmetic and medical device conversion methods were incorrectly using `product_name` for `genericName`


**Solution**:

- Updated `_convertCosmeticResults()` to set `genericName` to `null`

- Updated `_convertMedicalDeviceResults()` to set `genericName` to `null`

- Added clear comments indicating these fields are drug-specific only


**Impact**: Clean data separation between product types


---


### Image Search Functionality


#### Issue #3: Food Products Display as Drug Products in Image Results

**Severity**: High ¬†

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed


**Problem**:

- When scanning food products via image search, the result screen showed them as "Drug Product"

- The Product Details card displayed incorrect product type

- Alternative matches also showed wrong product types


**Root Cause**:

- The `toGenericProduct()` method in `ProductVerificationResponse` was unconditionally setting drug-specific fields for all products

- No type checking was performed before populating drug fields like `genericName`, `dosageStrength`, etc.


**Solution**:

- Enhanced `toGenericProduct()` method with product type validation

- Added `shouldIncludeGenericName` flag that only returns `true` for drugs and drug applications

- Only set drug-specific fields when `shouldIncludeGenericName` is `true`, otherwise set to `null`

- For food products, correctly use `company_name` as manufacturer


**Impact**: Food products from image search now display correctly as "Food Product"


---


#### Issue #4: Products Display as "Unknown Product"

**Severity**: High ¬†

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed


**Problem**:

- Some products were showing "Unknown Product" label instead of their actual type

- Occurred when backend didn't provide explicit product type in response


**Root Cause**:

- The `_determineProductType()` method was defaulting to `'unknown'` when it couldn't determine the type

- This caused the `productTypeDisplay` getter to return "Unknown Product"


**Solution**:

- Enhanced `_determineProductType()` with multiple detection layers:

¬† 1. Check `matchedProduct['product_type']` directly

¬† 2. Analyze registration number patterns (FR- for food, DR-/CPR- for drugs)

¬† 3. Expanded keyword matching with drug-specific terms (mg, ml, paracetamol, ibuprofen, med, pharma)

¬† 4. Expanded food keywords (juice, coffee, tea, candy, chocolate, biscuit, cookie)

¬† 5. Expanded cosmetic keywords (lotion, cream, shampoo)

¬† 6. If matched product exists but no type determined, default to 'drug' (most common)

¬† 7. Only return 'unknown' if no matched product and no keywords match

  

**Impact**: Products now correctly display their actual type instead of "Unknown Product"

## üöÄ Technical Improvements


### Enhanced Service Layer

- **text_verification_service.dart**: Complete rewrite of food product conversion logic with proper field mapping

- **image_verification_service.dart**: Added conditional logic to prevent drug fields on non-drug products

- **image_search_provider.dart**: Comprehensive product type detection with multi-layer fallback system


### Improved Data Model

- **generic_product.dart**: Enhanced `displayName` getter with robust fallback logic for all product types

- Better handling of 'unknown' product types throughout the application

  

### Code Quality

- Added clear inline comments explaining drug-specific field restrictions

- Improved null safety handling across all conversion methods

- More maintainable code structure with explicit product type checks
